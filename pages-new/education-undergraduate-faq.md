ENGR 3 satisfies the CMPSC 8 requirement (CMPSC 8 is not open to students who passed ENGR 3 with D- or higher or P).  
ðŸ‘‰ Submit a **Credit and Enrollment Clarification petition** via this [Google form](#) to process this.

**If Iâ€™ve already taken a CMPSC 9, 16, or higher equivalent, do I still need CMPSC 8?**

## PSTAT 8 / MATH 8

**Should I take PSTAT 8 or MATH 8?**

- **STSDS & ACTSC Majors:** PSTAT 8 is recommended (Pass 1 priority).  
- **FMS Majors:** PSTAT 8 if only taking required Math 117, 104A-B-C; otherwise, MATH 8 is recommended.  
- **Double major/minor in Math:** Take MATH 8 (PSTAT 8 doesnâ€™t count for other upper-division Math prerequisites).

**What are the prerequisites for PSTAT 8?**

Same as Math 8: Math 3C/3CI, 4A/4AI, 4B/4BI, 5A/5AI, 5B/5BI, 5C, or 6A/6AI, or 6B with a B or better.

**Do PSTAT majors get registration priority?**

- STSDS & ACTSC: Pass 1 priority for PSTAT 8, Pass 2 for Math 8.  
- FMS: Pass 1 priority for **both**.

**Can I take PSTAT 8 and MATH 8 together?**

No â€” PSTAT 8 is an illegal repeat of MATH 8.

**I failed MATH 8 â€” can I take PSTAT 8 instead?**

- If you got D- or higher or P â†’ **no**.  
- If you got F, NP, or W (0 units) â†’ **yes**.

**Max attempts:** Two total (across PSTAT 8 and MATH 8).

## Major & Pre-Major

**Whatâ€™s the difference between the BA and BS in Statistics and Data Science?**

- **BA:** General statistics (social, decision sciences); 36 upper-division units  
- **BS:** Specialized for biological, physical, technological sciences; 48 upper-division units (includes PSTAT 122)

**Whatâ€™s a pre-major? When do I declare the full major?**

Youâ€™re a pre-major while completing pre-major requirements. Declare the full major once youâ€™re in your last pre-major course (requires a Change of Major Petition).

## Registration

**The class is full â€” what do I do?**

- Add yourself to the **GOLD waitlist** (activates during Pass 2).  
- Waitlists auto-enroll until the end of Week 1.  
- After waitlists close, contact the instructor (not the department).

**How do I check my waitlist number?**

Check your position on GOLD for each lecture/discussion.

**I accidentally dropped a class â€” can I get an add code?**

No â€” dropped spots go to the next person on the waitlist.  
Follow the waitlist or crashing procedures to try again.

**My discussion section conflicts with another class â€” what should I do?**

- If space exists in another section, use the **switch** function in GOLD (donâ€™t drop!).  
- If no space, contact the instructor and TA to ask about unofficial section switching.
