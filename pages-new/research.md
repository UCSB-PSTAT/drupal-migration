## Shaping the Future of Data, Uncertainty, and Discovery

The Department of Statistics & Applied Probability pioneers interdisciplinary research in statistical theory, data science, financial mathematics, and applied probability, collaborating across fields like environmental science, computer science, and biomedicine. â€‹

### Statistical Theory & Methodology

Faculty members engage in foundational research in statistical theory, including asymptotic inference, nonparametric estimation, and the development of new statistical methodologies. This work provides the theoretical underpinnings for various applied statistical techniques.

### Applied Statistics in Environmental and Biomedical Sciences

The department applies statistical methods to a range of real-world problems in environmental sciences, biology, and biomedicine. Research includes the analysis of complex datasets to address issues such as ecological modeling, public health, and genetic studies.

### Interdisciplinary Collaborations

The department fosters interdisciplinary research, collaborating with other departments and institutions in areas like computer science, economics, and engineering. These collaborations aim to apply statistical expertise to diverse scientific and technological challenges.

### Financial Mathematics & Actuarial Science

Through the Center for Financial Mathematics and Actuarial Research (CFMAR), faculty explore quantitative finance topics like asset pricing, risk management, and derivatives modeling. Actuarial science research focuses on insurance analytics and risk assessment.

### Stochastic Processes & Applied Probability

Research in this area includes the study of stochastic differential equations, random processes, and their applications to fields such as finance, physics, and engineering. Faculty investigate the behavior of systems under uncertainty and develop probabilistic models.
