## [About](/about)

Our department aims to be a diverse community engaged in areas of education and [research](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/about/research) in Statistical Theory and Methods, Data Science, Actuarial Science, Financial Mathematics, and Applied Probability; our research collaborations represent a wide range of interdisciplinary fields including environmental science, computer science, and biomedical science. We are home to the UCSB [Center for Financial Mathematics and Actuarial Research](http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/cfmar/), an interdisciplinary research center providing leadership in quantitative finance. We also provide consulting services through our Data Science Consulting Laboratory: [DataLab](https://datascience.ucsb.edu/consulting)

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

At its core, our department views diversity and inclusion as critical within our mission to educate and prepare the future workforce of data scientists and quantitative thinkers. Increasing diversity across our field is essential in creating more productive, representative, and enriching outcomes as well as innovative solutions to critical problems. We recognize that historically, the job markets and academic communities in statistical theory and methods, financial mathematics, and actuarial science have been weighted toward racial, gender, and socioeconomically privileged communities. We are dedicated to correcting this imbalance in our own community.
