### Requesting an Account

To get an account, one needs to submit an application to the main office.

### Managing your account

Department accounts and e-mail accounts are now seperate entities. Department accounts are managed thru a directory server hosted within the department. E-mail accounts are now managed via connect/google agreement. To get information on how this works go [here](http://www.connect.ucsb.edu/), If you need instructions for changing your e-mail settings, vacation message, managing server-side filtering and changing your email account password, refer to [E-mail](/resources/computing/email) section. For accessing your webmail go here: [https://mail.google.com/a/ucsb.edu](https://mail.google.com/a/ucsb.edu)

Guideline for choosing a password

Use at least eight characters Make your password easy to remember but hard for others to guess Always use mixture of upper and lower case and change your password regularly.

### Changing your department account login password:

[![](https://kingslanding.pstat.ucsb.edu/computing/themes/mambo/icons/web.gif)Click here](https://kingslanding.pstat.ucsb.edu/setting/changeps.php "Outgoing link (in new window)") – Put in your assigned username and old password, then your new password and after putting the new password in again to confirm click the button, "Change" and you'll be using your new password to access all of our department file and compute servers.

Responsible use 

- Please keep your userid and password secret. Avoid sharing with others.
- Access only information that is your own, that is publicly available, or to which you have been given authorized access.
- Be considerate in your use of shared resources.
- Do not attempt to install programs on the computers in the lab.
- Contact [helpdesk@pstat.ucsb.edu](mailto:helpdesk@pstat.ucsb.edu "Write an email (mail client launch)") for requesting to install a new software.
- You must agree and sign the departments acceptable use policy for our network, before being allowed to access it.

### Account basics

Everyone in the Statistics department has one system account. Your account provides you with pstat file and compute server access. It allows connections to the RAS cluster as well – see [Cluster access](/resources/computing/cluster "Cluster").

### Windows Workstations

Once you are logged in, a prompt will ask if you would like to mount your home directory. You can store PSTAT-related documents to this space, which are backed-up nightly. You simply enter your PSTAT account login (same as email login) and your home drive will be mounted to drive H: in Windows. Just clicking “Submit” will skip this step.

Drive M:

Drive “M” found on the Windows workstations is a “Safe-zone” designed to share files or facilitate extended storage for more than a day. These items will not be erased when the machine reboots, which takes place nightly. All other documents saved to the desktop or elsewhere are not preserved, however.

Remember to log out of Windows when you're done, or drive H: will still point to your files!

### Printing

Printing is done through the Canon copier. Utilizing an assigned account number you can print to the canon copier from either your office desktop or one of the three lab computers next to the copier when you send the document to the copier it will be waiting in your canon mailbox to be released.
