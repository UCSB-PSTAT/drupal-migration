# TA Resources

A Teaching Assistant (title code 2310) is chosen for excellent scholarship and promise as a teacher, and serves an apprenticeship under the active tutelage and supervision of a regular faculty member. The department chair, acting upon nominations made by department members, is authorized to appoint TAs. However, the Dean of the Graduate Division must approve all exceptions to appointment criteria.

The selection, supervision, and training of all TAs are important responsibilities of the teaching department, and in particular the department chair. All candidates for appointment and reappointment are subject to careful review and recommendation.

The TA is not responsible for the instructional content of a course, for selection of student assignments, for planning of examinations, or for determining the term grade for students. Neither is a TA to be assigned responsibility for instructing the entire enrollment of a course nor for providing the entire instruction of a group of students enrolled in a course. The TA is responsible for the conduct of recitation, laboratory, or quiz sections under the active direction and supervision of a regular member of the faculty to whom final responsibility for the course's entire instruction, including the performance of TAs, has been assigned. (Refer to the UCSB Red Binder Section IV-10 for further information.)
