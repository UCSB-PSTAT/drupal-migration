# Research

The major research areas of our department can be divided into theoretical statistics and statistical methodology, applied statistics, and probability. Our faculty members are actively engaged in interdisciplinary research in such areas as mathematics, computer science, biostatistics, environmental sciences, and financial mathematics and statistics. These dynamic interactions with researchers in other disciplines are both personal, through joint projects supported by the NSF, NIH, and other government agencies, and through the activities of the DataLab situated in the Department.

The Department also hosts [Center for Financial Mathematics and Actuarial Research (CFMAR)](http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/cfmar) which provides national and international leadership in quantitative finance. Its research activities are directed toward study of financial markets, asset prices, risk management, investment strategies, derivatives pricing and hedging, and systemic risk among other topics.

Our faculty's applied statistics research spans a wide range of fields including environmental sciences, different biological and biomedical fields, population genetics, and finance.
