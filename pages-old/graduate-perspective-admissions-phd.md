# PhD in Statistics and Applied Probability

Admission decisions are made by the departmental Graduate Admissions Committee. Admission to the program is considered based on academic achievement, programmatic fit, and scholarly potential. 

Our graduate programs are open to those who hold a bachelor’s degree in Statistics, Mathematics, or other fields with strong quantitative requirements. The department is expecting that quantitative courses, particularly those regarding statistical theory, be passed with distinction.

## General Requirements

### Education

All applicants must hold a bachelor's degree in Statistics, Mathematics, or other strong quantitative fields

### Coursework

- One year of statistical theory that includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, best statistics and most powerful tests, regression and ANOVA concepts.
- One course in linear algebra that includes vector spaces, bases in vector spaces, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.

### GPA

The minimum undergraduate GPA requirement for admission is an overall 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. Meeting the requirement does not guarantee admission; the actual standard for admission is set by the current pool of applicants and is generally much higher.

### Exams

We will NOT require a GRE for applicants applying to the MA or PhD program in the Fall of 2024 (i.e. applying to be part of the entering class of Fall 2025).
