# Faculty Research

The department’s research expertise ranges from theoretical probability and statistics to advanced applied data analysis techniques, computational statistics, and financial mathematics and statistics. This is reflected in the curriculum, which prepares undergraduate and graduate students for careers in the insurance, financial and pharmaceutical industries. Many of our graduate students go on to careers in academia as faculty members in universities around the world.

The use of statistics in many disciplines provides an opportunity for inter-disciplinary collaboration between the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability and other departments on campus. Our faculty members are actively engaged in interdisciplinary research in such areas as mathematics, computer science, biostatistics, environmental sciences, and financial mathematics and statistics. The [Statistical Laboratory (Statlab)](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/resources/statlab) provides the entire UCSB campus with access to expertise in data-analysis methodology, experimental and study design, and statistical computation. At the same time, the Statlab trains Statistics graduate students in statistical consulting. The [Center for Financial Mathematics and Actuarial Research (CFMAR)](http://www.pstat.ucsb.edu/cfmar/) provides international leadership in quantitative finance and insurance analytics.

## Faculty Research Interests

Our faculty members each bring a unique perspective to the department and have widely varying interests, specialties, and expertise. Specifically, our faculty’s research interests are as follows:

### [ANDREW CARTER](/people/andrew-carter)

Research interests include: asymptotic statistical inference, comparisons of statistical experiments, density estimation and nonparametric function estimation.

### [NILS DETERING](http://detering.faculty.pstat.ucsb.edu/)

Research interests include contagion effects in financial networks by asymptotic methods facilitating random graphs. He is also working in the area of infinite-dimensional stochastic analysis and its applications to mathematical finance. This work includes infinite dimensional polynomial processes, Markovian representations for Stochastic Volterra equations, Heath-Jarrow-Morton models for energy markets and their calibration with neural networks. Nils Detering recently also worked on an interdisciplinary project with a colleague from the department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at UCSB. This project aims at modeling serotonergic fibers and their densities in the brain.

### [RAISA E. FELDMAN](/people/raya-feldman)

Research interests include: stochastic differential equations with non-Gaussian noises, time series, filtering problems.
