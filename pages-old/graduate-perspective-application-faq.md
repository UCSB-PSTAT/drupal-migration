### []()Who needs to take the TOEFL?

Anyone whose native language is not English is required to take the TOEFL. Exceptions will be made for students who have completed a degree at a U.S. institution. Proof must be provided by sending the final/official transcripts associated with the degree. The transcripts must indicate that the coursework and degree program has been/will be completed at the previous institution prior to starting in our program.

### []()Can I take the IELTS instead of the TOEFL?

Yes. The minimum score for the IELTS is an overall band score of 7 or higher.

You can log on to your online application and check your application status. The department will update it when your additional materials, such as transcripts, letters of recommendation, and your statement of purpose are received. Final admissions decisions will be made in April. You will receive an email from the Graduate Division indicating whether you have been admitted or denied.

### []()What classes are prerequisites for admission?

All students admitted should have a Bachelor's degree or its equivalent in mathematics, statistics or a related field with significant quantitative components. Coursework required for entering the graduate program includes a year-long introduction to probability and statistics using calculus. The statistical theory course should include estimation, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression, and ANOVA concepts. A linear algebra course that teaches vector spaces, bases, and eigenvalues is also required.

### []()Are there deferrals?

Not usually. Deferrals are available only if a student has a medical or family emergency, and is subject to the approval of the Graduate Dean. Please contact the [Graduate Program Assistant](mailto:gradinfo@pstat.ucsb.edu) for more information.

If you do not want to begin the program during the quarter you were admitted, and you do not qualify for a deferral, you will need to reapply for the quarter you wish to begin.

### []()How many students will receive financial aid?

The number of students who receive funding varies from year to year, depending on how many available packages we have. Generally, it is between 4 and 7 new students per year, but it can be more or less than that.
